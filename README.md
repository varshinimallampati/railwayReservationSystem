# railwayReservationSystem
This project, led by Varshini Mallampati, focuses on the development of a Railway Reservation System. The system's primary purpose is to provide passengers with the ability to inquire about available trains based on their source and destination, book and cancel tickets, and check the status of their booked tickets.

The case study's objective is to design and implement a comprehensive database that maintains records for different trains, including their number, name, source, destination, and operational days. It also manages train status data, such as booking dates, total available seats, and the number of seats already booked. Passengers can book tickets for trains with available seats, validating the train number and booking date before confirming the booking. If seats are available, a ticket with a confirmation status and a unique ticket ID is generated. If all available seats are booked, some tickets are issued with a waiting status. If the waiting list is exhausted, ticket booking is unavailable.

Assumptions have been made to facilitate the implementation of this case study, including a limit of five trains, bookings open for only the next seven days, two ticket categories (AC and General) with a maximum of 10 tickets each, and two tickets available for waiting status. The system doesn't consider in-between stoppage stations and their bookings.

The project emphasizes the need for maintaining a database to reduce manual errors in ticket booking and cancellation processes and improve the efficiency of maintaining customer and seat data. Automation helps remove manual record-keeping loopholes, enhances data processing speed, and can potentially be expanded to a web-based system for customer inquiries. By addressing data entry issues, the system aims to improve the overall passenger experience and provide up-to-date information on train schedules and cancellations due to various factors.
